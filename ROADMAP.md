# Roadmap

## Current: v1.0.13

First stable release. All agent experience features shipped. CLI-only (MCP removed in v0.10.0). 51 languages. Two full audits complete (v0.12.3 + v0.19.2). Recursive multi-grammar injection framework.

### 1.0.x Highlights

- v1.0.5: ASP.NET Web Forms (51st language), Make → Bash injection, schema v12 (`parent_type_name`)
- v1.0.6: SQ-2 richer NL descriptions (+3.7pp R@1 on hard eval)
- v1.0.7: SQ-4 call-graph-enriched embeddings (two-pass, IDF callee filtering)
- v1.0.8: 14-category audit — 14 findings fixed
- v1.0.9: SQ-5 module-level context (filename stems with generic filter)
- v1.0.10: Red team audit — 7 findings fixed (HNSW ID desync, PDF script injection, path traversal)

### Next — Commands

- [x] `cqs blame` — semantic git blame. Given a function, show who last changed it, when, and the commit message. Combines call graph with git log.
- [x] `cqs chat` — interactive REPL for chained queries. Readline, history, tab completion. Wraps batch mode.

### Next — Performance

- [x] PF-5: Lightweight HNSW candidate fetch (#510) — fetch only `(id, embedding)` for scoring, load full content only for top-k survivors.

### Next — Expansion

- [x] Pre-built release binaries (GitHub Actions) — adoption friction

### Future Languages — Priority Order

- [x] **Elixir** — Module + Macro exist. defprotocol → Interface, defimpl → Object. Clean mapping.
- [x] **Erlang** — FP + modules, behaviour → Interface, record → Struct.
- [x] **Haskell** — data → Enum, newtype → Struct, type synonym → TypeAlias, class → Trait, instance → Object.
- [x] **OCaml** — FP + modules. Uses `LANGUAGE_OCAML` export.
- [x] **Julia** — Scientific + types.
- [x] **Gleam** — FP + types.
- [x] **CSS** — Selectors + rules. Rule sets → Section.
- [x] **Perl** — Subs + packages. OOP via bless.
- [x] **HTML** — Semantic elements, script/style modules, landmark sections.
- [x] **JSON** — Top-level key-value pairs as Property.
- [x] **XML** — Top-level elements as Struct.
- [x] **INI** — Sections as Module, settings as Property.
- [x] **Nix** — Bindings with function/attrset expressions. Call graph via apply_expression.
- [x] **Make** — Targets as Function, variable assignments as Property.
- [x] **LaTeX** — Sections, commands, environments.
- [x] **Solidity** — Contracts, interfaces, libraries, call graph. Expression supertype workaround.
- [x] **CUDA** — Reuses C++ queries. Kernel-specific stopwords.
- [x] **GLSL** — Reuses C queries. Shader-specific stopwords.
- [x] **Svelte** — `tree-sitter-svelte-next`. Injection: `script_element/raw_text→JS`, `style_element/raw_text→CSS`. Reuses HTML helpers.
- [ ] **Clojure** — Blocked: `tree-sitter-clojure` 0.1.0 requires tree-sitter ^0.25, incompatible with 0.26.
- [ ] **Dart** — Blocked: old tree-sitter API (pre-0.24). Property covers properties, mixin → Trait.
- [x] **Razor/CSHTML** — `tris203/tree-sitter-razor` (git dep, forked). Monolithic grammar: C# + HTML + Razor directives. JS/CSS injection via `_inner` content mode.
- [x] **VB.NET** — `CodeAnt-AI/tree-sitter-vb-dotnet` (git dep, forked). Classes, modules, structures, interfaces, enums, methods, properties, events, delegates.
- [ ] **ArchestrA QuickScript** — No tree-sitter grammar exists. Needs custom grammar from scratch (VB-like syntax).

### ChunkType Variant Status

All 16 variants shipped and used across languages. Only one potential new variant remains: `Extension` for Swift.

| Variant | Shipped in | Used by |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `Module` | v0.16.0 | F#, Ruby, TS (namespace) |
| `Macro` | v0.17.0 | Rust, C (`#define(...)`) |
| `TypeAlias` | v0.17.0 | Scala, Rust, TypeScript, Go, C, F#, SQL |
| `Object` | v0.17.0 | Scala |

Infrastructure for adding variants is now cheap: per-language LanguageDef fields, data-driven container extraction, dynamic callable SQL. New variant = enum arm + Display/FromStr + is_callable decision + nl.rs + capture_types.

### Multi-Grammar Parsing

Injection framework shipped in v0.27.0 (PRs #540, #544). `InjectionRule` on `LanguageDef`, `parse_file_all()` combined method for single-pass chunk + relationship extraction via `set_included_ranges()`.

**Done:**
- [x] HTML → JavaScript (with TypeScript detection via `lang`/`type` attrs)
- [x] HTML → CSS
- [x] PHP → HTML → JS/CSS — recursive injection (depth limit 3). Two injection rules: `program/text` (leading HTML) + `text_interpolation/text` (HTML after `?>`). `content_scoped_lines` prevents container-spans-file problem.
- [x] Svelte → JS/TS, CSS — `tree-sitter-svelte-next`. Reuses HTML's `detect_script_language` for TypeScript detection.
- [x] LaTeX → code listings — `minted_environment` + `listing_environment`. Language detection from `\begin{minted}{python}` and `[language=Rust]` options.
- [x] Nix → Bash — `indented_string_expression` in shell contexts (buildPhase, installPhase, shellHook, etc.). `detect_nix_shell_context` checks parent binding name.
- [x] HCL → Bash — `heredoc_template` with shell identifiers (EOT, BASH, SHELL, etc.). `detect_heredoc_language` checks heredoc identifier.
- [x] Make → Bash — `recipe/shell_text` injection. Extracts shell commands from recipe bodies.
- [x] Razor → JS/CSS — `_inner` content mode for grammars without named content children. `detect_razor_element_language` for script/style elements.

**Next — New grammars required:**
- [x] Vue (.vue) → JS/TS, CSS, HTML — `tree-sitter-vue-next`. Identical injection pattern to HTML/Svelte. Post-processing: headings, landmarks, setup script detection.

**Next — Medium value (narrower scope):**
- [x] Markdown → fenced code blocks — custom line scanner + per-block tree-sitter parse. `extract_fenced_blocks()` + `parse_fenced_blocks()` in parser/mod.rs.
- ~~YAML → Bash~~ — closed: bash chunk query only captures `function_definition` nodes; GHA `run:` blocks are bare commands, so injection would produce zero chunks.

**Lower priority (niche or fragile):**
- [ ] Astro (.astro) → JS/TS + HTML — needs grammar
- [ ] ERB (.erb) → Ruby in HTML — needs grammar
- [ ] EEx/HEEx (.eex, .heex) → Elixir in HTML — needs grammar
- [ ] SQL in string literals (Rust, Python, Go, Java) — fragile detection
- [ ] GraphQL in tagged templates (JS/TS) — fragile detection
- [ ] CSS-in-JS (styled-components, emotion) — template literal detection

### Next — Search Quality (large corpus)

Stress eval against real codebases (cqs 2956 chunks, Flask, Express, Chi) showed MRR drops from 0.91 (fixture-only) to 0.46 (3969 chunks). Rust MRR = 0.000. NL descriptions are too generic to discriminate in large corpora.

- [x] SQ-1: Adaptive name_boost — sweep proved ineffective at scale. Dead end.
- [x] SQ-2: Richer NL descriptions — field names, dir-only file context. +3.7pp R@1 on hard eval (v1.0.6).
- [ ] SQ-3: Code-specific embedding model — evaluate UniXcoder, CodeBERT, or fine-tuned E5 as replacement for general-purpose E5-base-v2.
- [x] SQ-4: Call-graph-enriched embeddings — two-pass index with IDF callee filtering. 63% of chunks enriched (v1.0.7).
- [x] SQ-5: Module-level context in NL — filename stems with generic filter (11 stems: mod, index, lib, main, utils, helpers, common, types, config, constants, init). Regresses fixture eval ~3pp but improves real queries — shipped in v1.0.9.
- [x] SQ-6: LLM-generated function summaries — one-sentence purpose summary per function via small LLM at index time. Cached, regenerated on content change. Breaks local-only constraint; high accuracy. Batch resume on interrupt (v1.0.14).
- [x] SQ-8: LLM doc comment generation (PR #627). `--improve-docs` flag, per-language DocWriter, bottom-up source rewriting.
- [x] SQ-9: Simplify notes + embeddings architecture. Done in v1.1.0 — notes as annotations, 769→768-dim, schema v15→v16.
- [x] SQ-11: Type-aware embeddings (PR #630). Append full signature to NL. +3.6pp R@1, TS MRR +0.068.
- [x] SQ-12: Index-time HyDE query predictions (PR #631). `--hyde-queries` flag, Batches API, purpose="hyde".
- [x] SQ-7: LoRA fine-tuning of E5-base-v2. **Result: regresses hard eval, improves CoIR.**
  - v1-v3: all regressed on hard eval (70-73% R@1 vs 89% baseline). Catastrophic forgetting on confusable pairs.
  - v3 on CoIR CodeSearchNet: +4.3pp NDCG@10 (0.627→0.671). Every language improved. Go +7.8pp.
  - v3 on CoIR cosqa (transfer): +0.5pp NDCG@10. Genuine transfer, not just CSN memorization.
  - v4 training (200k CSN, 3ep) in progress — expect further gains.
  - **Key insight:** Different eval regimes surface different quality dimensions. Paper story.

- [x] SQ-10: Fine-tune code-specific cross-encoder reranker. **Result: REGRESSION.**
  - Trained on 50k CSN + 7.5k docstring pairs, 3 epochs. ONNX at jamie8johnson/code-reranker-v1.
  - Web-trained reranker: -10.9pp R@1. Code-trained: -81.8pp (catastrophic collapse).
  - Root cause: random same-language negatives too easy for cross-encoders.
  - Infrastructure kept: `CQS_RERANKER_MODEL` env var, eval harness in model_eval.rs.
  - Do NOT make reranking default. Revisit with hard negatives (V2) if warranted.

### Potential quality improvements (research backlog)

Ranked by difficulty / likely impact. 8 experiments + CoIR benchmark completed. Key lesson: different techniques help different eval regimes.

| # | Approach | Difficulty | Impact | Status |
|---|----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Weighted multi-signal fusion** | Easy | None (hard eval) | **Done (Exp 6)** — all 30 configs regress on hard eval |
| 2 | **Type-aware embeddings (SQ-11)** | Easy | +3.6pp R@1 | **Done (Exp 7, PR #630)** — first positive result. TS MRR +0.068. |
| 3 | **HyDE query predictions (SQ-12)** | Medium | Mixed | **Done (PR #631)** — shipped as `--hyde-queries`. Mixed on hard eval, neutral on stress eval. Untested on CoIR. |
| 4 | **LoRA fine-tuning (SQ-7)** | Medium | +4.3pp CoIR | **Done (v3)** — regresses hard eval but +4.3pp on CoIR. v4 training. |
| 5 | **Hard negative reranker (V2)** | Medium | Unknown | V1 failed (random negs). BM25 top-k negatives may fix. Untested on CoIR. |
| 6 | **ColBERT late interaction** | Hard | Potentially high | Token-level matching. New index structure. Not started. |

**Other ideas (lower priority):**
- **Query expansion** — synonym table or small LLM. Cheap recall boost. No model changes.
- **SPLADE** — sparse learned retrieval. Could replace/augment FTS5.
- **GNN on call graph** — embed by call graph position. Marginal over SQ-4 text enrichment.
- **Full 1.7M LoRA** — train on entire CodeSearchNet (not subset). v4 uses 200k.

### CoIR Benchmark Progress

**CoIR** (ACL 2025): 10 datasets, 8 tasks, 14 languages, 2M docs. Standard code retrieval benchmark.

**Results (CodeSearchNet, 6 languages):**

| Config | Avg NDCG@10 | vs Base | Leaderboard context |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| Base E5-base-v2 | 0.627 | — | #7 on leaderboard (50.9 overall) |
| E5 + NL enrichment | 0.626 | -0.001 | Heuristic too crude for CoIR |
| **E5 + LoRA v3** | **0.671** | **+0.043** | Approaching #5-6 territory |
| E5 + LoRA v4 | TRAINING | — | 200k CSN, 3ep (expect further gains) |

**Transfer (cosqa, out-of-distribution):** LoRA v3 +0.5pp NDCG@10. Genuine transfer.

**Leaderboard targets:** #1 SFR-Code-2B (67.41 avg, 2B params), #2 CodeSage-large-v2 (64.18 avg, 94.26 CSN), #5 Voyage-Code-002 (56.26 avg, 81.79 CSN).

**Remaining:** v4 eval, reranker configs, cosqa/stackoverflow transfer, full 10-task run for leaderboard.

### Literature survey (before paper)

- **CoIR benchmark** — running, first results in. Adapter at `~/training-data/run_coir.py`.
- **CoRNStack** — large-scale contrastive training, claims SOTA. Compare methodology.
- **CodeXEmbed** (COLM 2025) — generalist code embedding family.
- **C2LLM** (arXiv 2512.21332) — contrastive code LLMs (0.5B, 7B).
- **CodeCSE** (arXiv 2407.06360) — multilingual code/comment sentence embeddings.
- **Refining embeddings with PEFT** (arXiv 2405.04126) — LoRA on CodeT5+. Closest to our approach.
- **Lore** (arXiv 2603.15566) — git commit messages as structured knowledge for AI agents.

### Paper thesis

"Different evaluation regimes surface different quality dimensions. Adversarial evals (confusable function pairs) test precision — type-aware embeddings dominate. Realistic benchmarks (CoIR) test recall and ranking — LoRA fine-tuning dominates. A layered architecture lets practitioners choose the right combination for their use case."

### v1.1.0 Release Plan

**Execution order:**

1. **SQ-9: Notes simplification + 769→768-dim** (in progress — plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-03-19-sq9-notes-simplification.md`)
   - Phase 1: Remove notes from search results
   - Phase 2: Drop sentiment dimension (769→768)
   - Phase 3: Schema v15 migration + reindex required
2. **P3 deferred audit fixes:** EX-6/EX-7 (Pattern/ChunkType macros), CQ-13 (shared test fixtures), PERF-11/13/16 (batch INSERT, llm allocations)
3. **P4 refactors:**
   - PERF-12: CAGRA lazy rebuild (stop rebuilding index after every search)
   - CQ-11: Extract `Store::open_with_config()` (80% duplication between open/open_readonly)
   - EX-8: Shared CLI/batch arg structs via `#[command(flatten)]`
   - Split `search.rs` (2576 lines) → `search/` module (scoring, finalize, orchestration)
   - Extract enrichment pass from `cli/pipeline.rs` into own file
   - Extract ORT provider setup from `embedder.rs` into own module
   - DS-9: Watch mode Store re-open (OnceLock cache staleness)
   - RM-18: BatchContext reference LRU eviction
   - EX-9: LLM config env/config overrides (CQS_LLM_MODEL, CQS_API_BASE)
   - EX-11: Consolidate search scoring constants into ScoringConfig
4. **Release v1.1.0** — doc fixes:
   - "Local ML" → "Local-first ML, GPU-accelerated, optional LLM enrichment" in repo description
   - README pipeline: add Enrich step, fix dimensions, fix Describe
   - CLAUDE.md: fix notes wording ("available immediately" not "indexes immediately"), opus-only agents, complete agent command list
   - CLAUDE.md agent tools: add `plan, blame, doctor, index, stats, batch` — drop `chat, completions, init, watch`
   - Bootstrap skill: sync agent tools list, fix `--json`/`--format json`, add `--include-refs`, add missing skills, opus-only
   - All 769→768 dimension references across README, PRIVACY, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, CLAUDE.md, lib.rs
   - Re-run eval benchmarks or qualify numbers with measured version
   - Update Cargo.toml version to 1.1.0

### Parked

- **MCP server** — re-add as slim read-only wrapper when CLI features are rock solid. Architecture proven clean (removed in v0.10.0 with zero core changes).
- **Pre-built reference packages** (#255) — `cqs ref install tokio`
- ~~**Index encryption**~~ — closed: use OS-level disk encryption (BitLocker/LUKS/FileVault). sqlx doesn't support SQLCipher natively; not worth the complexity.
- ~~**Query-intent routing**~~ — closed: `--ref` flag covers explicit scoping, and hybrid RRF already boosts keyword matches naturally.
- ~~**Pattern mining**~~ — closed: manual notes + `cqs suggest` cover practical needs. Automated AST pattern recognition is research-grade effort for uncertain payoff.
- **Post-index name matching** — fuzzy cross-doc references

### Red Team — Accepted/Deferred

Findings from v1.0.10 red team audit. Accepted as trade-offs — each needs upstream API changes or schema work to fix.

- RT-DATA-2: Enrichment no idempotency marker (medium — needs schema change)
- RT-DATA-3: HNSW orphan accumulation in watch mode (medium — no deletion API)
- RT-DATA-5: Batch OnceLock stale cache (medium — by design, restart to refresh)
- RT-DATA-6: SQLite/HNSW crash desync (medium — needs generation counter)
- RT-DATA-4: Notes file lock vs rename race (low)

### Open Issues

**External/Waiting:**
- #106: ort stable (currently 2.0.0-rc.12)
- #63: paste dep unmaintained (RUSTSEC-2024-0436) — transitive via `tokenizers`, waiting on HuggingFace to switch to `pastey`

**Feature:**
- #255: Pre-built reference packages
- #555: EX-4 `where_to_add` catch-all for 44 languages (P4, extensibility)

**Infrastructure:**
- #389: CAGRA CPU-side dataset retention (~146MB at 50k chunks) — cuVS `search()` consumes the index, so `dataset` is needed for rebuild. Blocked on upstream API change.

## 1.0 Release Criteria

- [x] Schema stable for 1+ week of daily use (v12 since 2026-03-13)
- [x] Used on 2+ different codebases without issues (cqs, aveva, rust)
- [x] No known correctness bugs

1.0 means: API stable, semver enforced, breaking changes = major bump.
