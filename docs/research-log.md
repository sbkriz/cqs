# Research Log

Experiments toward a paper on layered code retrieval with a 110M parameter model.

**Thesis:** "Different evaluation regimes surface different quality dimensions. Adversarial evals (confusable function pairs) test precision — type-aware embeddings dominate. Realistic benchmarks (CoIR) test recall and ranking — LoRA fine-tuning dominates. A layered architecture — signatures for precision, LoRA for recall, LLM enrichment for coverage — lets a 110M model compete with specialized models 3-20× larger."

## Experiment Timeline

### Exp 1: Baseline NL Descriptions (SQ-2) — 2026-03-14
**PR #588, shipped v1.0.6**

Added struct/enum field names + directory path context to NL descriptions before embedding.

| Config | R@1 (hard) | Delta |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Baseline | — | — |
| +field names +dir context | +3.7pp | First positive result |

### Exp 2: Call-Graph Enrichment (SQ-4) — 2026-03-14
**PR #590, shipped v1.0.7**

Two-pass indexing: build call graph first, then re-embed chunks with caller/callee names appended. IDF-based filtering suppresses high-frequency utilities (>10% threshold).

- 63% of chunks enriched with call context
- Embedding quality improved for functions with rich call graphs

### Exp 3: Module-Level Context (SQ-5) — 2026-03-15
**PR #594, shipped v1.0.9**

Append filename stem to NL for module-level discrimination. Generic stems filtered (mod, index, lib, main, utils, helpers, common, types, config, constants, init).

- Regresses fixture eval ~3pp but improves real queries
- Shipped — real usage matters more than fixture eval

### Exp 4: LLM Summaries (SQ-6) — 2026-03-16
**PR #603, shipped v1.0.13**

One-sentence function summaries via Claude Haiku Batches API, prepended to NL descriptions. Cached by content_hash.

| Config | R@1 (stress) | Delta |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Without summaries | — | — |
| With generic summaries | -2.1pp | Regression — generic summaries add noise |

Key finding: generic "summarize this function" prompt produces descriptions too similar across functions. Led to Exp 8 (discriminating prompt).

### Exp 5: LoRA Fine-Tuning (SQ-7) — 2026-03-16 through 2026-03-20
**PR #624 (train-data), PR #637 (ship v3)**

Fine-tuned E5-base-v2 on CodeSearchNet triplets (query, positive, negative).

| Config | Samples | Epochs | CSN NDCG@10 | CosQA (transfer) |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Base E5 | — | — | 0.627 | 0.329 |
| v3 | 50k | 1 | 0.671 | 0.334 |
| **v5** | **166k** | **1** | **0.683** | **0.348** |
| v4 | 166k | 3 | 0.680 | 0.305 |
| v6-mixed | 166k+CosQA+SO | 1 | 0.644 | 0.332 |
| Rank 32 | 50k | 1 | 0.682 | — |

All variants use the same 186k-line training data file (CSN triplets + docstring-as-query pairs). The "+docs" label on v3 was misleading — all configs include docstrings. The only differences are `--max-samples` and `--epochs`.

**Original decision (2026-03-20):** Ship v3. Made at 11:17 AM before v5 results existed (12:33 PM).

**Corrected (2026-03-21):** v5 is strictly better than v3 on both CSN (+1.2pp) and CosQA transfer (+1.4pp). v4 over-specializes — 3 epochs on 166k data causes Python to spike (0.971) while CosQA collapses (0.305, below base). v5 avoids this by using 1 epoch on the full dataset.

**Untested:** 166k at 2 epochs — the midpoint between v5 (1ep, good transfer) and v4 (3ep, over-specialized). May find a sweet spot.

Per-language NDCG@10 (verified from `~/training-data/coir-results/`):

| Language | v3 | v5 | Delta |
|----------|------|------|-------|
| Go | 0.758 | 0.770 | +0.012 |
| Java | 0.610 | 0.626 | +0.017 |
| JS | 0.523 | 0.535 | +0.012 |
| Ruby | 0.590 | 0.589 | -0.001 |
| Python | 0.929 | 0.953 | +0.023 |
| PHP | 0.614 | 0.624 | +0.010 |

**Action:** Switch default to v5. Convert safetensors → ONNX, upload to HuggingFace.

**Rank investigation (2026-03-21):** rank-32 (r=32, alpha=64) trained on full 186k at 1 epoch scored 0.681 CSN, 0.350 CosQA — within noise of v5 (rank-16, 0.683/0.348) and sweep-200k (rank-16, 0.680/0.353). Doubling LoRA parameters adds nothing. rank-64 dir was created but never trained. **Rank is not a lever.**

**Verified complete results (all from `~/training-data/coir-results/`):**

| Config | Rank | Samples | Epochs | CSN | CosQA |
|--------|------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| base E5 | — | — | — | 0.627 | 0.329 |
| sweep-10k | 16 | 10k | 1 | 0.671 | 0.327 |
| v3 | 16 | 50k | 1 | 0.671 | 0.334 |
| sweep-75k | 16 | 75k | 1 | 0.675 | 0.341 |
| sweep-200k | 16 | ~180k | 1 | 0.680 | 0.353 |
| rank-32 | 32 | ~186k | 1 | 0.681 | 0.350 |
| **v5** | **16** | **166k** | **1** | **0.683** | **0.348** |
| v4 | 16 | 166k | 3 | 0.695 | 0.304 |
| v6-mixed | 16 | 166k+mix | 1 | 0.644 | 0.332 |
| pipeline | 16 | (v3+enrich) | — | 0.626 | — |

**Next experiments (prioritized):**

1. **Hard negative mining** — biggest untapped lever. CoRNStack ablation shows +9.4pp from hard negs alone (63.3→72.7), independent of data cleanliness. Our random negatives are the main gap between us and SOTA.
   - Recipe: pre-compute similarity matrix with v5, softmax sampling with temperature annealing (τ: 0.05→0.001), InfoNCE loss (τ=0.07). See CoRNStack (arXiv 2412.01007).
   - `filter_csn.py` already exists for consistency filtering (ran it — 0 pairs filtered, CSN is clean). Need to extend with hard negative mining.
   - CoRNStack's data is open source at github.com/gangiswag/cornstack — could use their pre-mined negatives directly.

2. **Expand training languages: Rust, C++, TypeScript** — CSN only covers Go/Java/JS/Ruby/Python/PHP. Our users search Rust/C++/TS heavily but the model has zero fine-tuning signal for those. Plan:
   - Mine docstring-function pairs from popular public repos (tokio, servo, llvm, chromium, TypeScript compiler, deno)
   - Use `cqs train-data` to extract triplets from git history of those repos
   - Consistency-filter with v5 model (remove noisy pairs where cosine sim < threshold)
   - Add to training set alongside CSN data, retrain
   - Eval on hard eval (which includes Rust/TS queries) and CoIR
   - Risk: dilution (v6-mixed showed CSN+CosQA+SO hurts). Mitigation: filter aggressively, keep CSN as majority.

3. **Language-specific LoRA adapters** — LoRACode (ICLR 2025, arXiv 2503.05315) found language-specific adapters massively outperform task-specific. Up to 86.7% MRR improvement. Our v5 trains one adapter across all 6 langs. Routing by detected language could be a big win.

4. **166k / 2 epochs** — quick sanity check. Does CosQA degrade gradually or cliff at 3ep?

5. **Full 10-task CoIR for v5** — only CSN + CosQA tested. 8 tasks unknown. Free to run.

6. **Knowledge distillation from CodeSage-large** — use 1.3B model as teacher, train E5 to match its similarity scores. More complex to implement.

**Why hard negatives are the priority:**
- CoRNStack's ablation is definitive: consistency filtering (+6.6pp) only helps noisy data (The Stack). CSN is already clean — confirmed by our `filter_csn.py` run (0 pairs filtered, same 1.71M lines). But hard negative mining (+9.4pp) works regardless of data quality. It forces the model to learn fine-grained semantic differences instead of surface-level language patterns.
- SFR-Code-2B (#1 on CoIR) also uses contrastive learning with hard negatives.
- Our failed reranker (SQ-10, -81.8pp) had the same root cause: random negatives too easy.

**Rejected approaches:**
- CodeSage-large-v2 — 94.26 on CSN but 20% R@1 on hard eval (can't parse NL queries)
- Consistency filtering — CSN is already clean (0 pairs filtered). CoRNStack's gain was on The Stack (raw GitHub scrapes), not CSN.
- Mixed LoRA (v6, CSN+CosQA+SO) — dilutes CSN signal without improving CosQA
- v4 (166k/3ep) — highest CSN but CosQA collapses. Over-specialized.
- rank-32/64 — no gain over rank-16. Rank is not the bottleneck.
- Pipeline enrichment on CoIR — hurts -4.5pp (see Exp 12).

### Exp 6: Weighted Multi-Signal Fusion — 2026-03-19
**PR #630 (weight sweep)**

30-config parameter sweep: name_boost, keyword boost, RRF weights.

| Result | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| All 30 configs | Regress on hard eval |
| Optimal | Embedding-only (no fusion) |

**Conclusion:** For adversarial confusable pairs, pure embedding similarity beats any weighted combination. Fusion may help on diverse queries but hurts precision.

### Exp 7: Type-Aware Embeddings (SQ-11) — 2026-03-19
**PR #630, shipped v1.2.0**

Append full function signature to NL description before embedding.

| Config | R@1 (hard) | Delta |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Without signatures | 87.3% | — |
| **With signatures** | **90.9%** | **+3.6pp** |

TypeScript MRR +0.068. First positive result on hard eval since SQ-2.

### The LLM Text Arc (Exp 4 → 8 → 11)

This is the central narrative of the research. Three experiments, one question: can LLM-generated text improve code embeddings?

**The naive answer was no.** Exp 4 showed generic summaries *hurt* retrieval (-2.1pp). "Summarize this function" produces descriptions like "processes data and returns a result" for every function. The embeddings converge — every vector drifts toward "generic utility function" in embedding space. More text, less discrimination.

**The breakthrough was prompt engineering, not model changes.** Exp 8 tested four prompt strategies on the same LLM (Haiku), same functions, same eval:

| Prompt Strategy | R@1 | MRR | vs Raw Code |
|-----------------|-----|-----|-------------|
| No LLM text (raw code only) | 47.3% | 0.673 | — |
| Generic ("Summarize this function") | 60.0% | 0.726 | +12.7pp |
| **Discriminating ("What makes this unique")** | **63.6%** | **0.763** | **+16.3pp** |
| Contrastive (top-5 neighbors as context) | 65.5% | 0.769 | +18.2pp |

Even the generic prompt helps vs raw code (+12.7pp) — NL text is inherently closer to NL queries than code is. But the discriminating prompt adds another +3.6pp by forcing the LLM to surface *what's different* about each function: the specific algorithm, the edge case, the data structure choice. This is the single biggest lever we found across all 11 experiments.

**Then doc comments added a second signal on a different axis.** Exp 11 wrote standard doc comments (not discriminating — just "describe params and returns") back to source files, re-indexed, and measured:

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| R@1 (hard) | 90.9% | **92.7%** | **+1.8pp** |
| NDCG@10 (hard) | 0.951 | **0.965** | **+0.014** |

**Why do non-discriminating doc comments help when generic summaries hurt?** Because they flow through *different paths* and carry *different information*:

| Stream | Prompt | Stored | Feeds embedding via | What it captures |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Discriminating summary | "What makes this unique" | DB (`llm_summaries`) | Enrichment pass NL | *Distinctiveness* — algorithm, approach |
| Doc comment | "Describe params/returns" | Source file (`chunk.doc`) | NL generation | *Structure* — types, args, error cases |

Generic summaries failed because they attempted distinctiveness and produced sameness. Doc comments succeed because they don't try to be distinctive — they add structured parameter/return/error information that gives the embedding additional axes of discrimination. A function that "takes a HashMap and returns Option<Vec>" occupies a different region of embedding space than one that "takes a &str and returns Result<(), Error>", even if both "process data."

**The lesson:** LLM text is the biggest lever for embedding quality, but *what you ask for* matters more than the model. Prompt engineering delivered +16pp. LoRA fine-tuning delivered +4.4pp. The layered approach (discriminating summaries for distinctiveness + doc comments for structure) is additive because the two text streams are complementary, not redundant.

Ship: discriminating prompt (simple, cheap, one LLM call per function). Contrastive is future optimization (requires two passes + neighbor lookup).

Template comparison confirms — DocFirst (which prioritizes `chunk.doc` in embedding text) is now the clear winner:

| Template | R@1 | MRR | NDCG@10 |
|----------|-----|-----|---------|
| Compact | 89.1% | 0.933 | 0.949 |
| **DocFirst** | **92.7%** | **0.948** | **0.960** |

### Exp 9: Cross-Encoder Reranking (SQ-10) — 2026-03-19
**PR #629**

Trained cross-encoder reranker on 50k CSN + 7.5k docstring pairs, 3 epochs.

| Config | R@1 (hard) | Delta |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| No reranker | 90.9% | — |
| Web-trained reranker | 80.0% | **-10.9pp** |
| Code-trained reranker | 9.1% | **-81.8pp** (catastrophic) |

**Root cause:** Random same-language negatives too easy for cross-encoders. Need hard negatives (BM25 top-k) for V2. Infrastructure kept, do NOT make default.

### Exp 10: HyDE Query Predictions (SQ-12) — 2026-03-20
**PR #631, shipped v1.2.0**

LLM predicts 3-5 search queries per function at index time. Embedded alongside NL description.

| Config | R@1 (hard) | R@1 (stress) |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Without HyDE | — | — |
| With HyDE | Mixed | Neutral |

Shipped as optional enrichment (`--hyde-queries`). Untested on CoIR.

### Exp 12: Full Pipeline on CoIR — 2026-03-21
**In progress**

Previous CoIR runs tested individual components in isolation (base model, LoRA alone, NL enrichment alone). This experiment applies the full free enrichment pipeline as an `E5Pipeline` wrapper in `run_coir.py`:

- LoRA v3 model (trained on 50k CSN+docstrings)
- Signature extraction + append (SQ-11)
- Function name tokenization (SQ-2)
- Doc comment extraction from code (DocFirst template)
- Language detection

**Not included** (require API calls or full project context):
- LLM discriminating summaries (SQ-6) — $250 for full CSN, possible on small tasks for ~$2
- Call graph enrichment (SQ-4) — needs full project, not isolated snippets
- Module path context (SQ-5) — no file paths in CoIR

### Result: Pipeline enrichment HURTS on CoIR (-4.5pp)

| Language | v3 (raw) | v5 (raw) | Pipeline (v3+enrichment) | Delta vs v3 |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Go | 0.758 | 0.770 | 0.718 | -0.040 |
| Java | 0.610 | 0.626 | 0.572 | -0.038 |
| JS | 0.523 | 0.535 | 0.485 | -0.038 |
| Ruby | 0.590 | 0.589 | 0.547 | -0.042 |
| Python | 0.929 | 0.953 | 0.867 | -0.063 |
| PHP | 0.614 | 0.624 | 0.566 | -0.049 |
| **AVG** | **0.671** | **0.683** | **0.626** | **-0.045** |

**Why:** CoIR queries are NL, corpus is raw code. The LoRA was trained on that exact format (query→code). Prepending signatures, tokenized names, and doc snippets shifts the passage distribution away from what the model learned. The enrichment is designed for *index-time* use where we control the full NL generation pipeline, not as a drop-in text transform on raw code.

**Lesson for the paper:** NL enrichment is a *product feature* (helps when you own the whole pipeline), not a *model improvement* (hurts on standard benchmarks). The honest CoIR number is **v5 raw = 0.683**. The enrichment's +1.8pp on hard eval is real but only within cqs's controlled environment.

### Exp 13: Full 10-Task CoIR with LoRA v5 — 2026-03-21

First complete CoIR benchmark run. 9 tasks (codeforces dataset unavailable on HF).

| Task | NDCG@10 | Subtasks | Notes |
|------|---------|----------|-------|
| stackoverflow-qa | **0.877** | 1 | NL→NL, E5 base strength |
| codefeedback-st | **0.735** | 1 | Single-turn code feedback |
| codesearchnet | **0.683** | 6 | NL→code, LoRA target (+5.6pp vs base) |
| synthetic-text2sql | **0.567** | 1 | NL→SQL, zero SQL training |
| codesearchnet-ccr | 0.490 | 6 | Cross-code retrieval |
| codefeedback-mt | 0.399 | 1 | Multi-turn feedback |
| cosqa | 0.348 | 1 | Code QA |
| codetrans-dl | 0.174 | 1 | Code translation |
| apps | 0.107 | 1 | Program synthesis |
| **Overall avg** | **48.67** | 9 | **#8 on leaderboard (was #7 with base E5 at 50.90)** |

**Key finding: LoRA fine-tuning for code search is a specialization trade-off.** v5 gains +5.6pp on CSN but loses ground on generalist tasks (SO-QA, text2sql, codefeedback), pulling the overall average below base E5 (48.67 vs 50.90). The model specialized toward NL→code at the cost of NL→NL and code→code retrieval.

**Implication for the paper:** The layered enrichment pipeline (which doesn't touch model weights) may be better for overall benchmark performance than LoRA fine-tuning. Hard negative mining with task-balanced loss could improve code search without degrading generalist ability.

**Implication for the product:** In cqs, we only do NL→code search. The LoRA + enrichment pipeline is the right choice for the product (0.683 CSN vs 0.627 base). The generalist degradation doesn't matter because cqs never does SO-QA or text2sql.

| LoRA v5 | 0.348 | 0.172 | 0.586 |
| LoRA v6-mixed | 0.332 | 0.150 | 0.574 |

Key finding: v4 over-specializes on CSN Python (0.971!) at the expense of CosQA transfer (0.305). v5 has the best CosQA transfer (0.348) but v3 is the sweet spot for ship.

### Full CoIR Leaderboard (from archersama.github.io/coir)

10 tasks, ranked by average across all. Our CSN-only results aren't directly comparable to the full leaderboard avg, but CSN is the most relevant task.

| # | Model | Params | Avg (10 tasks) |

| 12 | GTE-Base-en-v1.5 | 110M | 36.75 |
| 13 | Contriever | 110M | 36.4 |

**Our position:** E5-base-v2 is already #7 out of 13. With LoRA v3 (+4.3pp on CSN), we'd approach #5-6 territory on the full benchmark — competing with models 3-60× our size.

**Paper angle:** Among 110M-class models (BGE-Base, GTE-Base, UniXcoder, Contriever), E5-base-v2 dominates at 50.9 vs next-best 42.77. Our LoRA + layered enrichment architecture extends that lead further while staying at 110M params — runnable on CPU in <100ms per query.

## Key Lessons

1. **Generic LLM descriptions hurt.** They make all functions sound the same. Discriminating prompt (+16pp) vs generic (+12.7pp).
2. **Adversarial evals ≠ realistic evals.** LoRA regresses hard eval but +4.4pp on CoIR. Type signatures help hard eval but are invisible on CoIR.
3. **Fusion doesn't help precision.** 30-config weight sweep — pure embedding beats all combinations on confusable pairs.
4. **Cross-encoder reranking needs hard negatives.** Random negatives are too easy. Catastrophic failure (-81.8pp) with code-trained reranker.
5. **Doc comments improve embeddings.** Writing back LLM-generated docs to source → richer NL → better vectors (+1.8pp R@1).
6. **Data > architecture for LoRA.** Rank 16→32 is flat. 50k→200k samples gives diminishing returns. Quality > quantity.
7. **In-product enrichment ≠ benchmark improvement.** NL enrichment (signatures, doc text, names) helps +1.8pp inside cqs but hurts -4.5pp on CoIR. The model was trained on raw code; enrichment shifts the passage distribution. Benchmark numbers must use the raw model.
8. **Don't ship before eval completes.** v3 was shipped as default before v5 results existed (11:17 AM vs 12:33 PM). v5 is strictly better on every metric.
9. **LoRA fine-tuning is a specialization trade-off.** Full 10-task CoIR: v5 drops from #7 (base E5 50.90) to #8 (48.67). Gains on CSN (+5.6pp) come at the cost of generalist tasks (SO-QA, text2sql, codefeedback). Random negatives teach language discrimination, not semantic discrimination — over-specializes.
10. **Hard negatives may fix the trade-off.** CoRNStack achieved 72.7 CSN without degrading other tasks. Their hard negatives force semantic discrimination that transfers across tasks. Random negatives → narrow specialization. Hard negatives → deep understanding.

## Publication Assessment (2026-03-21)

**Status: Not yet publishable. 2-3 weeks from submittable draft.**

### What we have
- 13 experiments with verified metrics across three eval regimes (hard eval, CoIR CSN, full 10-task CoIR)
- The LLM text arc: generic hurts → discriminating +16pp → doc comments +1.8pp on top
- The benchmark-vs-product gap: enrichment helps in-product, hurts on benchmarks
- The specialization trade-off: LoRA helps code search, hurts generalist retrieval
- 10 LoRA variants with data scaling analysis
- Full 10-task CoIR numbers: 48.67 avg (#8), with per-task breakdown

### What's missing for publication
1. **Near-SOTA results.** 0.683 CSN is good for 110M but 48.67 overall is below base E5. Need hard negative mining to push CSN toward 0.72+ without degrading generalist tasks.
2. **Novelty framing.** Individual techniques aren't new. The combination + evaluation methodology insights are the contribution.
3. **Controlled ablations.** Current comparisons are ad-hoc. Need confidence intervals, same-seed runs.
4. **Training data expansion.** CSN only covers 6 languages. Rust/C++/TypeScript from public repos would strengthen practical angle.

### Strongest paper angle
"LoRA fine-tuning for code search is a specialization trade-off: a 110M model study." The contribution isn't SOTA results — it's the systematic analysis of what helps, what hurts, and why. The benchmark-vs-product gap, the specialization trade-off, the LLM text arc, and the layered pipeline architecture are all underexplored in the literature.

### Roadmap to submission
1. Hard negative mining (CoRNStack recipe) — fix the specialization trade-off **(in progress: mining 1.7M pairs)**
2. Expand training data (Rust/C++/TS) — strengthen practical angle
3. Run full CoIR with base E5 for controlled comparison
4. Controlled ablation table — each layer added/removed with confidence intervals
5. Write draft — intro (gap), method (layered pipeline), experiments (three regimes), discussion (trade-offs)

### Dimensions of code retrieval quality

Useful framework for designing eval sets and understanding which techniques help which dimension:

1. **Semantic depth** — understanding what code *does*. Hard negatives target this.
2. **Task breadth** — NL→code vs NL→NL vs code→code. LoRA narrows this.
3. **Text distribution** — raw code vs enriched descriptions. Enrichment shifts this.
4. **Abstraction level** — "implement a cache" → HashMap+TTL code. Neither LoRA nor enrichment bridges this well.
5. **Structural awareness** — recursion, patterns, error handling. Embeddings see tokens, not structure.
6. **Negative space** — "sort without allocating" requires understanding what code avoids.
7. **Granularity** — function vs file vs concept level retrieval.
8. **Cross-lingual transfer** — Python's `sorted(key=)` = Rust's `.sort_by_key()`. CoIR-CCR tests this (we score 0.490).

Hard negatives primarily improve dimension 1 but may also help 4 (forcing abstract→concrete reasoning) and 8 (same-language negatives force semantic over syntactic discrimination). A dimension-specific eval would reveal which.

### Hard negative mining (Exp 14, in progress)

**Status:** Mining 1.7M CSN pairs with v5 model. FAISS index for top-100 nearest neighbors, γ=0.95 false negative filter, temperature=0.05 softmax sampling, 7 negatives per query, same-language constraint.

**Script:** `~/training-data/mine_hard_negatives.py`

**Test run (1000 pairs):** 100% got 7 negatives, ~49 valid candidates per query after filtering. Negatives are semantically related (same domain, different function) — exactly what we want.

**After mining:**
1. Train v7 with `train_lora.py --data csn_hard_negs.jsonl`, eval on hard eval + full 10-task CoIR
2. Optionally augment with (discriminating_summary, code) pairs via `augment_with_summaries.py` for Dimension 4 (abstraction level)
3. Key question: does CSN improve without degrading generalist tasks?

**Summary augmentation (Dimension 4):** Script `~/training-data/augment_with_summaries.py` adds (discriminating_summary, code) pairs alongside (docstring, code) pairs. For our codebase, summaries are cached in cqs store. For CSN, would need ~$2 Haiku batch to generate. The discriminating summaries capture *what makes a function unique* — bridging abstract intent to concrete implementation. Free data augmentation for indexed codebases.

**Note:** cqs users are always AI agents, not humans. Agent queries tend to be more precise and technical than human queries — "function that validates JWT tokens and checks expiration" rather than "JWT stuff." This affects which quality dimensions matter most: semantic depth (1) and abstraction level (4) over task breadth (2).
