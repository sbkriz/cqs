# Audit

Run the 14-category code audit. Full design: `docs/plans/2026-02-04-20-category-audit-design.md`

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` — batch number (1-3) or `all` for full audit

## Batches

| Batch | Categories |
|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Code Quality, Documentation, API Design, Error Handling, Observability |
| 2 | Test Coverage, Robustness, Algorithm Correctness, Extensibility, Platform Behavior |
| 3 | Security, Data Safety, Performance, Resource Management |

## Process

### Setup

1. **Archive previous audit**: If `docs/audit-findings.md` or `docs/audit-triage.md` exist, rename both with the version suffix (e.g., `audit-findings-v0.9.1.md`, `audit-triage-v0.9.1.md`). Each audit starts with fresh files.

2. **Enable audit mode**: `cqs audit-mode on --expires 2h -q` — prevents stale notes from biasing review

### Per-Batch

3. **Create team**: One team per batch (`audit-batch-N`)

4. **Spawn teammates**: One per category (use `sonnet` for judgment-heavy categories, `haiku` for mechanical ones)

5. **Each teammate prompt must include**:
   - Their category scope (from table below)
   - Instruction to read archived triage files (e.g., `docs/audit-triage-v*.md`) — skip anything already triaged in prior audits
   - Instruction to read `docs/audit-findings.md` first — skip anything already reported by earlier batches in this audit
   - Instruction to append findings to `docs/audit-findings.md`
   - Format: `## [Category]\n\n#### [Finding title]\n- **Difficulty:** easy | medium | hard\n- **Location:** ...\n- **Description:** ...\n- **Suggested fix:** ...`
   - The **cqs tools** section below — agents should use cqs for exploration, not just raw file reads

## cqs Tools for Agents

Include this block in every agent prompt so they can use the project's own search tool:

```
## cqs Available (via Bash)

You have `cqs` on PATH. Use it for faster code exploration — still read source directly to verify findings.

- `cqs "query" --json` — semantic search (finds code by concept, not text)
- `cqs "name" --name-only --json` — definition lookup by function/type name
- `cqs read <path>` — file with notes injected as comments. Use instead of raw Read.
- `cqs read --focus <fn>` — function + type dependencies only. Saves tokens.
- `cqs dead --json` — find dead code (uncalled functions)
- `cqs callers <fn> --json` — who calls this function
- `cqs callees <fn> --json` — what this function calls
- `cqs explain <fn> --json` — function card (signature, callers, callees, similar)
- `cqs similar <fn> --json` — find duplicate/similar code
- `cqs deps <type> --json` — type dependencies: who uses this type
- `cqs context <file> --json` — module overview (chunks, callers, callees)
- `cqs gather "query" --json` — smart context: seed search + call graph BFS
- `cqs scout "task" --json` — pre-investigation: search + callers/tests + staleness + notes
- `cqs task "description" --json` — implementation brief: scout + gather + impact + placement
- `cqs impact <fn> --json` — what breaks if you change this
- `cqs test-map <fn> --json` — tests that exercise this function
- `cqs trace <source> <target> --json` — shortest call path between two functions
- `cqs review --json` — diff review: impact + notes + risk scoring
- `cqs health --json` — codebase quality snapshot: dead code, staleness, hotspots
- `cqs stale --json` — check index freshness (files changed since last index)
```

6. **Shutdown team** after all agents complete

### After All Batches

7. **Triage**: Read `docs/audit-findings.md` in full, then classify:
   - P1: Easy + high impact → fix immediately
   - P2: Medium effort + high impact → fix in batch
   - P3: Easy + low impact → fix if time
   - P4: Hard or low impact → create issues
   - **Write triage to `docs/audit-triage.md`** — fresh file with P1-P4 tables (include Status column). This survives context compaction.

8. **Disable audit mode**: `cqs audit-mode off -q`

## Category Scopes

| Category | Covers (merged from) |
|----------|---------------------|
| Code Quality | Dead code, duplication, complexity, coupling, cohesion, module boundaries |
| Documentation | Accuracy, completeness, staleness of docs and comments |
| API Design | Consistency, ergonomics, naming, type design |
| Error Handling | Result chains, context, recovery, swallowed errors |
| Observability | Logging coverage, tracing, debuggability |
| Test Coverage | Gaps, meaningful assertions, integration tests, adversarial/edge-case coverage (malformed input, concurrent access, NaN/Inf values, error paths) |
| Robustness | unwrap/expect, edge cases (empty/huge/unicode/malformed), panic paths |
| Algorithm Correctness | Off-by-one, boundary conditions, logic errors |
| Extensibility | Adding features without surgery, hardcoded values |
| Platform Behavior | OS differences, path handling, WSL quirks |
| Security | Injection, path traversal, file permissions, secrets, access control |
| Data Safety | Corruption, validation, migrations, races, deadlocks, thread safety |
| Performance | O(n²), unnecessary iterations, batching, caching, I/O patterns |
| Resource Management | Memory usage, startup time, idle cost, OOM protection, leaks |

## Mandatory First Steps per Category

Run these cqs commands **before** manual exploration — they surface the highest-value data in a single call.

**Batch 1:**
- **Code Quality**: Run `cqs dead --json` + `cqs health --json` first.
- **Documentation**: Run `cqs health --json` for staleness counts.
- **API Design**: No mandatory command.
- **Error Handling**: No mandatory command — grep-driven.
- **Observability**: No mandatory command — grep for `tracing::` patterns.

**Batch 2:**
- **Test Coverage**: Run `cqs health --json` first (includes untested hotspots). Also check for **adversarial test gaps**: functions that accept user input, external data, or embeddings should have tests for malformed/adversarial inputs (empty, NaN, truncated, wrong-type, concurrent).
- **Robustness**: No mandatory command — grep for `.unwrap()`, `.expect(`, `panic!`.
- **Algorithm Correctness**: Use `cqs explain <fn> --json` on algorithmic functions.
- **Extensibility**: Run `cqs health --json` for hotspot overview.
- **Platform Behavior**: No mandatory command.

**Batch 3:**
- **Security**: No mandatory command.
- **Data Safety**: No mandatory command.
- **Performance**: Run `cqs health --json` first (identifies hotspots).
- **Resource Management**: No mandatory command.

## Rules

- Collect ALL findings before fixing ANY
- One batch at a time (context limits)
- Clean up teams between batches
- Stop at diminishing returns during discovery
- Once triaged, complete the tier — don't suggest stopping mid-priority
- Cross-check findings against open GitHub issues — note overlaps as "existing #NNN"
- **Mark items in `docs/audit-triage.md` as fixed when done** — update the Status column (e.g., `✅ PR #N` or `✅ fixed`). This is the source of truth for what's been addressed.
